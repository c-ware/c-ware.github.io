            A problem that shows its head from time to time when coding in C is</br>
            the lack of data structure implementations. The only standard data</br>
            structures in C are statically sized arrays. Languages such as C++,</br>
            Python, and Java have many types of data structures found in their</br>
            standard libraries. Some operating systems do come with their own</br>
            implementations of data structures, like FreeBSD for example, which</br>
            <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tree&sektion=3&format=html">has a red and black tree</a>
            in the <code>sys/tree.h</code> header, but there is not really</br>
            a group of data structure implementations.</br>
            </br>
            More often than not, these data structure implementations also have</br>
            little to no type-safety involved, so they must resort to void pointers.</br>
            If someone wants to fill an array with integers, they cannot do so with</br>
            a for loop because all the pointers to integers will point to the same</br>
            integer, so they will often resort to <code>malloc</code>'ing space for each new</br>
            integer, for example. This not only makes the program in question</br>
            use more heap memory, but it also makes it easier for bugs to</br>
            introduce themselves because C's type system (what little it has</br>
            at least) cannot detect incorrect usage of a type.</br>
            </br>
            A major goal of this project is to produce a reliable collection of</br>
            data structures, which are type safe, and as portable as can be.</br>
            To pull off type safety, we use macros to implement our data structures.</br>
            This allows for type-neutral code, while also retaining a (small) speed</br>
            boost from code being in-lined, although this is most likely a micro-</br>
            optimization at best.</br>
            </br>
            Our data structure implementations also employ an 'operation mode' which</br>
            allows programmers to use the data structure on the stack as opposed to</br>
            the heap. In stack mode, Operations that involve resizing for example, will</br>
            not resize the data structure, and will instead raise an error when full.</br>
            The same applies to other types of operations.</br>
            </br>
            With all that being said, here are the following data structure implementations</br>
            that we provide:</br>
            <ul>
                <li>carray</li>
                <li>chash</li>
            </ul>
