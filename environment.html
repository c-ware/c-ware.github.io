    <title>Environment</title>

    <body>
        Something that should be considered on occasion when writing any sort of software</br>
        or library is that of naming. Naming is important, and can make your code easier to</br>
        use or extend. However, it is also important when it comes to documentation and interfaces</br>
        that programmers use to interact with your library or software.</br>
        </br>
        Because of this, in the case where someone using our code is worried about <i>name collisions</i>,</br>
        we provide a way to help make name collisions with things like manuals, and headers a little</br>
        less worrisome.</br>
        </br>
        This 'environment' can be generated by running the command below in your terminal:
        <code>
    curl https://c-ware.github.io/scripts/make-environment.sh | sudo bash
        </code>
        What the script does is as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Create a new manual category, and modifies mandb to add a new section.</li>
            <li>Create a folder to hold project headers.</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
